  "summary": "The call was a health check-in for Wolfram, a pet being monitored for pruritus (itching) by Jojo Vet. The pet's owner, Wolf, reported a moderate level of itching (rated 2 out of 4) which is slightly better than the previous check-in. The itching is primarily affecting Wolfram's right leg, with sores and redness present, but no hair loss. Wolfram had a medicated bath once that day, and his energy, appetite, and sleep quality have been slightly reduced. The assistant will call daily to check on Wolfram's condition, with the next call scheduled for 6 PM. The veterinarian will review the update and reach out if any changes to the treatment plan are needed.",
